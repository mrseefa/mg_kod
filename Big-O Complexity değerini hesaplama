This is a program that provides basic functionality for managing a list of "Cicek" (flower) structures. 
The user can add, edit, delete, show, or search for Cicek objects. 
The information of each Cicek object consists of its name, count, temperature, and humidity. 
The program uses a vector to store the list of Cicek objects and writes the information of the Ciceks to a text file when they are added. 
The program has a menu-based interface that allows the user to select the desired operation.
